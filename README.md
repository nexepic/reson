Reson is a robust command-line tool designed for detecting code duplication across multiple source files. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis, reson ensures accurate and reliable detection of duplicated code, supporting various programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python.

This tool helps maintain high-quality codebases by identifying redundant code blocks, enabling effective refactoring and optimization.

## Features

- **AST-based Analysis**: Ensures precise duplication detection by analyzing the code structure rather than plain text.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Define the minimum number of lines to consider as duplicates.
- **Exclude Directories/Files**: Easily exclude specific paths from the analysis.
- **Flexible Output Options**: Generate detailed reports in JSON and other formats.
- **Debug Mode**: Access additional logs for debugging and deeper analysis.

## Example

Detect code duplication in the src directory, excluding tests and build directories, and output the results to result.json:

```bash
./reson \
  --source-path src \
  --excludes tests,build \
  --output-format json \
  --output-file result.json \
  --threshold 10
```
